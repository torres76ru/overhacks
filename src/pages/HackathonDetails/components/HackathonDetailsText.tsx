      In Q2 2024, we're thrilled to introduce the "One BNB ‚Äì Coding the Future"
      hackathon, setting the stage for yet another exciting chapter in the
      evolution of blockchain technology!

      The inception of opBNB and BNB Greenfield in 2023 marked the commencement
      of the ‚ÄúOne BNB‚Äù multi-chain journey, accompanied by a wealth of ideas and
      feedback from the vibrant BNB Chain community. This theme now serves as
      the bedrock of our hackathon, reflecting BNB Chain's ongoing pursuit of
      pioneering blockchain solutions.
